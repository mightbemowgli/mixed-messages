# mixed-messages

This was originally the Mixed Messages JS project completed as part of the
Full Stack developer program on Codecademy. I decided to come back and
make a basic page just to practice utilizing event handlers some more.

Pretty straightforward, but here's a little [demo](https://mightbemowgli.github.io/mixed-messages/). I'd like to come back
and really flesh this out, maybe create an actual random charactersheet generator
that rolls a stat array and assigns them to stats, etc.
